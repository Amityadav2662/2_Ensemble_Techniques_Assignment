    "# Q2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using different types of base learners in bagging?\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "1. Diversity in Base Learners:\n",
    "Using different types of base learners increases diversity in the ensemble, as each learner may have different\n",
    "strengths and weaknesses.This diversity enhances the overall robustness of the model, reducing the risk of \n",
    "overfitting and improving generalization to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Improved Generalization:\n",
    "Bagging tends to work well with base learners that have high variance and are prone to overfitting. By combining\n",
    "the predictions of multiple models, bagging can reduce variance and improve generalization, especially when the\n",
    "base learners are complex and sensitive to noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Parallelization:\n",
    "Bagging is inherently parallelizable because each base learner can be trained independently.This makes bagging \n",
    "efficient for implementation on parallel computing architectures, leading to faster training times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "1. Limited Improvement with Stable Models:\n",
    "Bagging might not provide significant benefits if the base learners are already stable and have low variance. \n",
    "Bagging is more effective when applied to base learners with inherent variability, as it leverages the diversity\n",
    "among the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Increased Computational Complexity:\n",
    "Training multiple base learners and combining their predictions can increase computational complexity.For large \n",
    "datasets or computationally expensive base learners, the added computational cost may become a limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Potential for Overfitting on Noisy Data:\n",
    "If the base learners are highly flexible, there is a risk of overfitting on noisy or irrelevant features in the \n",
    "training data.This can happen when the base learners are too complex and are not regularized appropriately."
